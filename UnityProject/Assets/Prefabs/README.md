# Prefabs

- `Player.prefab` (to be created in Unity) should contain the `CharacterController`, `PlayerController`, `PlayerLook`, `Interactor`, and `Flashlight` components wired together.
- `InvestigationPoint.prefab` (to be created in Unity) should hold the `InvestigationPoint` script implementing `IInteractable`.
